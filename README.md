This is the *cinema-Room-Manager-Kotlin* project I made myself.

This project works with input and output in Kotlin. You will deal with lists and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.

Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

This project does the following tasks:

* Visualize the seating arrangement by printing it to the console.
* Calculate the profit from all the sold tickets.
* Set the ticket price.
* Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement.
* Handle some input errors.
